Unlike any other resort at Airlie Beach, the magical gateway to the Whitsundays on the doorstep of the Great Barrier Reef, One Whitsundays Resort, Spa and Conference Centre has been bestowed its title for good reason. While there are other resorts at Airlie Beach, there is only five star One Sundays.\n\nThe boutique resort complex comprises only 75 strata titled apartments of 1,2 and 3 bedrooms that entail spectacular views, spacious areas, quality finished and a focus on indoor-outdoor living.\n\nFor the investor they have a choice to rent it out on the normal rental market or they can enter their apartment into the Mantra servicing pool and holiday in their apartment for 4 weeks of the year.",
