"description": "Enquiry code for this property: 2728.\n\nFirst home owners and smart investors can secure this home that\u2019s sitting on a very handy third of an acre allotment.\n\nBecause the land is so big the owners were able to place a 3 car garage alongside, which accentuates the value on offer.\n\nHeating and cooling are taken care of by virtue of a slow combustion wood heater and also a split system air conditioner. Also, the hot water system is only around 2 years old.\n\nYes this property is in need of some improvements, but a large block like this, means that any improvements that you make will be maximised in later years.\nNot far from shops, schools, tafe, hospital.\nThis is your chance to get into entry level housing that has the scope to grow with your needs as your family expands. Stop paying the landlord and start paying your own rent while interests rates are at historic lows.\nThe big block of land means subject to council approval you could put a pool in or a granny flat if council approves it, ud have to check to make sure with council this would be ok.\n\nThe repayments on this property are likely to be similar to your current rental. \nThe thing about this property that stands out from the rest is the BIG BLOCK OF LAND, 3 CAR GARAGE, AND THE UNFINISHED EXTENSION PIECE ON BACK OF HOUSE.\nVery good value property \n\nOnce again please note the enquiry code for this property: 2728, as it is required when phoning about the home.",

Privacy is not an issue as it is located in a very quiet neighbourhood well shielded from ambient noise. \n\nWHAT ELSE COMES WITH THE HOUSE?\n\n* The 55 inch Samsung smart TV that is mounted on the living room wall,\n* The 50 inch smart TV that is mounted in the master bedroom,\n* All window coverings\/blinds,\n* All plants, pots and gardens,\n* Dishwasher,\n* Garden and pool lighting which is time-programmed for maximum enjoyment and entertainment,\n* Electricity system has dual tariffs for maximum cost effectiveness,\n* Work benches and storage racks in garage.\n\nCONSIDERATIONS:\n\nAs we have a young child, there are minor stains on the lounge room carpet. Instead of replacing this now, we are willing to provide $1000 towards the cost of replacing them so that you can pick your own style and colour.\n\nThe children\u2019s bedroom\/nursery has tasteful custom vinyl stickers affixed to the bedroom walls and cupboard which are pictured. They are able to be removed easily if the new owner decides to do so, but they were expensive and we are leaving them on the walls so that they can be enjoyed by the new tenant if desired.\n\nThe house is always tidy and clean and we have just had it professionally cleaned; however we are a working family and the house will not be \u201cmagazine\/showroom ready\u201d at all hours of the day and night. Upon vacating the house after sale, we are willing to again have the inside professionally cleaned to assist with your move. There is literally nothing left for you to do but move in. \n\nCairns has previously had cyclones and minor flooding in the past. This house is 24 meters above sea level and is out of the government and council set danger zones for flooding. The house is also constructed to withstand cyclones. The power in Mount Sheridan is underground and the house has not lost power in any storm or emergency yet. This is a very safe and comfortable house in this region. \n\nPROPERTY INFO:\nLot\/Plan \u2013 49\/RP749763\nLocal Government \u2013 2080 Cairns Regional\nLand size \u2013 775sqm\nUnimproved land value - $146,000 as of 30\/06\/2015\n\nplease contact anytime to organise an inspection.\n\nEnquiry code for this property: 5093",

"description": "Enquiry code for this property: 2005\n\n\u2018Ingebyra\u2019 is just 20 minutes South of Canberra or Queanbeyan on the sealed end of Williamsdale Road in the peaceful town of Burra.\n\nFour bedroom 1950's worker's cottage, originally part of historic estate, sits on 35.2 acres with original verandah, stained glassed windows, brick fireplaces and long established trees. Across the luscious paddocks a beautiful meandering creek runs through the property aside a small hillside of native trees.\n\nThis character filled home has since had french doors and double glazed feature windows added to the living room. As well as solar hot water system and the roof recently repainted and floors re-lacquered. The kitchen splash area and shower recess have been newly tiled.\n\nAn outside rustic room close to the main house is the perfect granny flat, teenage retreat or studio with own power, phone and plumbing.\n\nThis is the perfect home for the avid gardener and renovator to restore it and add on modern conveniences. What it lacks in modern building it makes up for in charm and half a century old trees. It was purchased ten years ago for 500k and then sold to family for less when became deceased estate. Certainly it is a property with unique potential.\n\nFor a short while home to artist Joan Holt, who fell in love with its ambience and set it up for free range chickens for which the property is council approved to run 450.

"description": "Enquiry code for this property: 6012\n\nThis is a rare opportunity to own a slice of Adelaide Hills paradise in the much sought after suburb of Aldgate. A property like this does not come onto the market place often, in fact this is the first time this home will be sold since being built in 1972. This road has numerous homes that have yet to be sold since they were built with them being passed down from family member to family member or still with the original owners. Therefore if you want a chance to own a property in this quiet no-through road, then you must act quickly. \n\nWhen you enter this property the stress that has accumulated throughout your day immediately vanishes as you enjoy the picturesque 3441m2 landscaped and native allotment. Put your feet up and relax with a glass of red (or two) as you enjoy the views from the large undercover balcony overlooking several water features with waterfalls. As you take your gaze away from the flora it will not be uncommon to refocus it on the native fauna with the likes of ducks, koalas, kookaburras and even the odd kangaroo as they too enjoy this beautiful setting. \n\nThe first thing you notice as you enter the home is the large open plan living area with a fantastic brand new kitchen! A great design about the open plan living area is that it can also be segregated with large bi-fold doors. The bedrooms are very generous in size with all of them incorporating built in wardrobes. In addition to the master bedroom it has a walk in wardrobe and en-suite. \n\nThere is a workshop\/shed as well as plenty of room under the house to create your own personalised space. As well as plenty of space, there is amble off-street parking with a double carport and a garage..\n\nAdditional Features:\n* Ducted reverse cycle air conditioning\n* Dishwasher\n* Tasmanian oak floorboards in the living area\n* No water bills ever! Self sufficient on larger rainwater storage.\n* Fire pump and sprinkler system\n* Garden irrigation system\n* Vegetable Garden\n* Chicken Coop\n\nEnquiry code for this property: 6012",

"description": "Enquiry code for this property: 3052\n\nThis oceanfront, architect designed home is rare indeed. Right on the safe, sandy and exclusive Garden Bay Beach. The elevated block has immaculate gardens that run to the beach and adjoining parkland. It has rare, open ocean views with many Sydney Hobart yachts and whales sighted from the broad elevated deck over the years. There is great fishing, diving, surfing and endless rocky foreshore exploring for the kids, right off the back doorstep, in full view from mum's kitchen window. \n\nThe home has two living areas, both with beach views, air conditioning, gas fireplace, a double lockup garage plus a large studio\/workroom with pottery kilns and a wine cellar. There is also a third toilet and an extra garden shower adjacent to a heated spa (with beach views) to warm up in after that invigorating winter dip in the ocean.\n\nThis prime position is much admired by locals and holiday-makers alike. There are only a handful of absolute oceanfront homes located on a beach in N.S.W.. No more will ever be developed. Beachfront is rare and tightly held! This home is the first time to market since first developed in the 1960s. The owners bought the land off the original developer, then rebuilt as their family grew and rebuilt again for retirement. \nIf you are a genuine $1m+ buyer, do your research and make an appointment to view with the owner. You will never regret buying this jewel.\nTHE HOME IS IDEAL FOR DUAL OCCUPANCY!\nThe owners have purchased elsewhere and have sensible price expectations. \nThey can consider some vendor finance or a long settlement.\n\nEnquiry code for this property: 3052",

"description": "Enquiry code for this property: 3648\n\nThis townhouse would suit both the investor or owner occupier.\n\nIt is located just a short walk to the water, restaurant precinct on the esplanade, the RSL is at the end of the street, it is next door to the school and the Council Library is just across the road, a short stroll away is the Bluewater Shopping Centre for groceries, post office etc. If you are energetic the Tennis Club is virtually across Anzac Avenue. The Council have also just completed a beautification programme of the whole street upgrading the surface of the road, gutters and footpaths. How much better could it be!!!\n\nYou arrive home and enter through either the front door or the garage with remote controlled roller door. Internal access through the laundry, downstairs toilet and storage room and you are in the large open plan living\/dining area ready to have your first coffee, beer or wine. Open the many massive windows for some sea breeze and you know you are home to relax. The room has a lovely outlook over the garden and courtyard on both sides. This level also has a large kitchen with heaps of cupboard space and the dining area opens out onto the private court yard.\n\nIts time to head on upstairs to the massive master bedroom with gigantic mirrored wardrobe doors which make the room look even bigger and gives loads of storage for your clothes. The bedroom has a private balcony on which you can sip your morning coffee and check out the weather for the day. \n\nThe bathroom upstairs again is massive with two way entry. It is equipped with shower, full sized bath, toilet, and vanity with huge mirror adding to the feel of spaciousness. \n\nThe second and third bedroom are also large and can easily accommodate a queen sized bed. Both have built ins with plenty of storage.\nYour sheets and linen can be stored in the decent size cupboard in the hall.\n\nThis townhouse is located at the back of the block so there is no passing car or pedestrian traffic to pass your front door offering a sense of security and peace. It's in a small block of only 4 and is self managed so body corporate fees are very low and the exterior has just been painted so not much future work is required.\n\nIf you are a gardener there is a small patch of garden for you to test out your green fingers and get creative in. \n\nThe block has two visitor car spaces in the front of the complex. The townhouse is fully fenced so it could be very possible to have a small pet. The garages separate each townhouse so you will not hear your neighbours. It's so peaceful!\n\nIf you are a family, couple or single wanting to be alone or share with others you should act fast as this is a rare find in Redcliffe. \n\nEnquiry code for this property: 3648",

"description": "Phone enquiry code for this property: 3673\n\nDELORAINE, CIRCA 1870\nDeloraine is a heritage listed bluestone homestead offering 3 bedrooms and a separate, self-contained guest cottage. It is situated on a 3794 square metro block in the town precinct with established gardens and trees. The building could serve as a family home and\/or as a guest accommodation facility, should you have the desire to continue the established bed and breakfast operation. You can take advantage of the commercial kitchen and expand the business to provide light meals in the historic dining room and sunny atrium. The house and gardens also lend themselves to cater for weddings and functions. Or you can simply relax and enjoy the clean air, slower paced lifestyle and friendly country town atmosphere that Tenterfield offers.\n\nTenterfield is located at the junction of the New England and Bruxner highways in NSW. It is a short 3 hour drive from Brisbane, 2.5 hours from Byron Bay and 8 hours from Sydney. This historic town, thanks to Sir Henry Parkes, is the birthplace of Australia's federation and was immortalized in Peter Allen\u2019s tribute to his grandfather, the Tenterfield Saddler. The town offers a range of tourist attractions - granite belt wineries, picturesque hiking trails, Thunderbolt country - and is surrounded by magnificent national parks.\n\nEnjoy living in an environment that has four distinct seasons: flowers announcing the arrival of spring, warm summers, autumns filled with brilliant red and gold colours, and sunny winter days with clear, crisp nights. \n\nIf you are considering a change in lifestyle: a tree change; semi retirement with a small business to operate; better value for money away from the high-cost city property markets, this is an opportunity that cannot pass you by. At a sales price of $625,000 Deloraine offers excellent value for your property dollars.\n\nFor a closer look, visit the Deloraine Tenterfield website.\n\nGeneral features\n3 Bedrooms in the main house (including one with ensuite)\n1 Ambulant bathroom\nFully self-contained guest cottage\nCommercial kitchen, large dining room and caf\u00e9 style atrium\n2 Car garage and off-street parking for 11 vehicles\n\nPlease call or email to arrange an inspection.\n\nPhone enquiry code for this property: 3673",

"description": "Phone enquiry code for this property: 3792\n\nBellingen has been described by Australian travel magazines as the new Byron Bay, but what locals have always known is there is something else, enchanting and untouched, that is unique to Bellingen alone. \n\nUp the quiet Darkwood Road, along the Bellinger River and past a forest full of flooded gums, sits two houses and several acres.\n\nFrom the wide deck area spanning three quarters of the house, is a view so close to the river frontage you could throw a stone into it. So close, if you wake up early enough, you can glimpse the elusive platypus in its natural habitat. \n\nWhen the smell of fire warms the dusk afternoon, you can take solace inside this house built from Australian timbers. Due to its passive thermal design, in summertime too this house stays nice and cool. \n\nBut come night-time all year round, the stars and glow worms will be competing for your attention. \n\nWith surrounding Japanese-inspired gardens built up over 15 years and a 100+year old Red Cedar tree standing prominently in the front yard, here, nature and home are almost indistinguishable. \n\nMain Features\n\u2022\tHalf a km of pristine river frontage \u2013 you can drink the water straight from the river\n\u2022\tPark like property - size 8.5 acres. Two large fenced pastures with a water trough. \n\u2022\tSpring fed water from rainforest creek to drink\n\u2022\tPristine river 10m from the house to swim in.\n\u2022\tSwim in the rock pool 20m from the deck of the house or swim 50m in the river from your own private grassy river flat\n\u2022\tsit on the veranda and watch the platypus\n\u2022\tBeautiful Japanese garden surrounding the house\n\u2022\tRiver banks have been regenerated and are weed free\n\u2022\tRiver banks covered in established red cedars and regenerated rainforest\n\u2022\tAncient red cedar tree is the focus point of the garden\n\u2022\tContemporary hand made built home from Australian milled timbers such as red Mahogany cladding, Australian red cedar window frames, tallow wood decking and feature rosewood and teak timber inside the home\n\u2022\tGranite and stainless kitchen. Kitchen has beautiful walk in pantry. Contemporary stove and drawers. Watch the fish in the river as you cook in the kitchen\n\u2022\tOpen plan living with a series of double opening doors on the veranda\n\u2022\tPassive solar designed home\n\u2022\tMain house has a large main bedroom with a storeroom or second bedroom.\n\u2022\tGuesthouse has a one bedroom, open plan living with kitchen and bathroom. The guesthouse has plenty of room for a sofa lounge for extra guests.\n\u2022\tTwo Bathrooms: Main House Bathroom has Villeroy & Boch fittings\n\u2022\tEstablished vegetable garden & fruit trees\n\u2022\tTriple carspace garage.

"description": "Phone enquiry code for this property: 5039\n\nThis century old dwelling sits facing north on a large block (27 perches in the old measurement) on the side of Hamilton Hill, 5km from the Brisbane CBD. \nThe road layout ensures that only local traffic passes the property.\nThe elevation of the block provides panoramic views towards Bartley's Hill and northern suburbs.\nA number of sought after schools and colleges including: Clayfield College, St Rita's College, St Margaret's Anglican Girls School, St Agatha's School, Eagle Junction and Ascot State Schools are within a 2 km radius of the property as are the iconic Breakfast Creek Hotel, the Racecourse Road precinct and Eagle Farm Racecourse. \nThe domestic and international airports and the Hamilton cruise ship terminal are all within a 15 minute drive.\nWalk to the end of Joynt St and you are at Allan Boarder Field, home to the Bupa National Cricket Centre and Crosby Park Rugby field.\nThe property is also close to public transport, Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital and all retail amenities and is a short walk from the Brisbane River with all its charm. A minute\u2019s drive from the Inner City Bypass ensures that you have direct access to the entire network of road tunnels to fast track your trip to all parts of Brisbane and both North and South Coasts. \nThe dwelling, while solid and intact, suits a complete refurb or redevelopment.

"description": "Phone enquiry code for this property: 5086\n\nDon\u2019t risk losing out on this rare find in the highly sought after and tightly held pocket of \"Wishart Outlook\" estate.\nVery few houses come up for sale in this area and when they do, they sell quickly. This low-set family home will be no exception for so many reasons. Located in a quiet cul-de-sac, kids can safely play cricket in front of the house and use it as an extension of the front yard. \n\nWith summer approaching, you will be the envy of your friends for the sparkling pool in your backyard. The large entertaining area allows you to host your friends, while keeping an eye on the kids in the pool. The home has plenty of space for everyone to enjoy together or separately, with a large open-plan living, dining and kitchen and a second separate living area that is just as large. Parents will love the private sanctuary of the large master bedroom with its own ensuite. \n\nYou will be in great company, surrounded by other impressive homes that are lovingly looked after by house-proud neighbours. In addition to being family friendly, quiet and safe, this pocket is very close to everything that counts in South East Queensland. As soon as you drive out of your secure double garage, you are only a few minutes away from Garden City shopping centre and the Pacific and Gateway motorways, both of which bring the Brisbane CBD, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coasts within a very short drive for either work or a weekend escape. Alternatively, the numerous nearby bus stops make public transport a breeze.\n\nPhone enquiry code for this property: 5086",

"description": "Phone enquiry code for this property: 4080\n\nLooking for buyers for a newly built property in Westonia. The concrete slab, steel framed, colourbond house is on a large block (1012m2), covering 272 of those square meters, including a huge 142.8 m2 of veranda. There is also a large 9x6m powered shed and 45.6m2 powered carport.\n\nThere are still a few small jobs yet to be finished on the outside, sellers are intending to concrete the shed floor and the verandas, however they are also happy to look at offers from anyone interested in finishing it themselves.\n\nThe living area is open, with dining, tv and kitchen blending together easily. There is a huge main bedroom with walk in closet and two more good sized rooms, one with a built in closet and the other lending itself to a great office\/study. Both the laundry and bathroom are also large, with a huge 900x1200 glass shower, and there is a separate water closet. There is plenty of storage with huge built-in laundry cupboard, built-in linen cupboard, and a large walk in pantry for the kitchen. The house is fully insulated (roof and walls), with a 3hp reverse cycle air conditioner in the living area, and also has a split system solar hot water system. There is easy care vinyl flooring throughout, with tiles to the laundry, bathroom and toilet.\n\nThe outside of the property has huge potential. There is a water stream feature at the front of the property, which will be gorgeous once completed. All other sections are a blank canvas ready for a green thumb. The huge veranda area could be closed off if desired, to produce an amazing outdoor living space.\n\nThe property is situated in the beautiful, quiet, friendly town of Westonia. For more information about the town please head to www.westonia.wa.gov.au. Westonia is only 35 mins from Merredin, a major town with service, retail and industrial sectors, as well as a Hospital and large K-12 school. Westonia has a visiting doctor once a month, as well as weekly visits from a Nurse Practitioner. There is also a working gold mine (Edna May - Evolution Mining) next to town, which provides many work opportunities. This also provides great rental potential.\n\nThe Wheatbelt is an amazing place to live, with (contrary to popular belief) many wonderful places to visit as well as a vivid pioneering history. So for anyone looking for a \"bush change\", Westonia is the place for you!\n\nIf possible, a long settlement, or re lease until the end of 2015 would benefit the sellers.\n\nPhone enquiry code for this property: 4080",

The house has been built to enable a future house to be built further back on the block if desired, with a separate access driveway. This would allow the current home to be rented out.\nHouse could be regarded as a \"renovators delight\", however it is quite comfortable and very liveable.",

There is also no better King George Whiting fishing area than on the year round calm waters of the bay which are protected from the Southern Ocean by Jones Island. Proposed new Marine Parks do NOT affect recreational fishing in the bay. There are also great beach and bush walking areas right at your front and back doors.\n\nThis is a very rare opportunity to secure a freehold, absolute waterfront property with peaceful lifestyle and\/or tremendous rental opportunities, offering so much for a WIWO price of $295,000.",

"description": "The property is a four bedroom, two bathroom, brick veneer, slab on ground, metal roofed house, which was built in 2000, and enjoys a North Easterly aspect. It sits toward the front of a fully fenced, pet friendly one acre (0.4 Hectare) gently sloping rural residential freehold block situated a little out of town in a no through road.\n\nThe enquiry code for this property is 1375.\nPlease note this 4 digit code very carefully as it is required for all phone enquiries.\n\nThe house is approximately 130 square meters internal with an additional 130 square meters attached under roof as verandahs, carport Etc. A five kilowatt grid connected solar system and a large evacuated tube solar hot water system are installed and active. Internally, all kitchen appliances have recently been replaced with quality brands. \n\nClimate controlled multi zone air-conditioning is fully ducted to all living areas and bedrooms via a top quality inverter system. Ceiling fans have been retained where appropriate. Town water, power, phone and Broadband internet services are available. All bedrooms are carpeted.\n\nThere is property access from the street via two gated concrete entrances to a semi circular gravel driveway. A three bay steel shed is directly accessible from the circular driveway. Drive right around access is available to the rear of the house as well as the rear of the property. Undercover parking, with access to the house veranda's is part of the drive right around feature. Large fully mulched ornamental gardens surround the rear of the house on a terrace providing privacy. Special attention has been paid to storm water control and you will never get wet in this house. The vendors zero turn ride-on mower will remain with the property. A small house orchard of mature citrus and banana varieties along with younger mango, grape and olive plantings is currently maintained organically.\n\nThis home is situated fifteen to twenty minutes from the Gladstone CBD and ten to fifteen minutes to major supermarkets and patrolled swimming beaches at Tannum Sands. Benaraby primary school is within easy walking distance and buses to Tannum Sands high school stop around the corner. The Lake Awoonga boat ramps are within fifteen minutes as is the Tannum Sands and Boyne Island boat ramps.\n\nImportant Considerations.\n\nThe vendor is very keen to rent back the property for three to six months at a negotiable rate and this factor may be decisive where any price negotiations are entered into. The vendor may also be willing to refund reasonable travel costs to the successful out of town or interstate buyer as part of price negotiations.",

"description": "The enquiry code for this property is 1856. \nYou will be asked for the code when you call about this property.\n\nRiverside tranquillity, built on a standard block for comfortable and efficient living by the current owners 45 years ago. As a professional couple we needed a house which combined convenience in all aspects with minimum requirements for up-keep of both house and garden. \n\nOver the years it has been extended and refurbished to care for an expanding family and to maintain that comfort and convenience. \nIts 260 sq metres of living space features a split level design with kitchen, dining, and lounge areas facing north, fronted by an extensive tiled patio, overlooking the river. Summer shade is provided by a purpose-designed removable canvas awning.\n\nThe upper level has 3 bedrooms and a bathroom, separate shower room, and a toilet room. An architect designed master bedroom area was added later, with en suite bathroom, walk-in wardrobe and study.\n\nUnderneath is a lower level \u201cGranny flat\u201d with its own bathroom and kitchen facilities, a garage\/workshop, and an extensive storage area. There is a double carport under the master bedroom area.\n\nHeating is all electric with under-floor cables in the living area slab (Thermostatically controlled) and storage block heaters in other areas.\n\nThe high pitched, tiled roof is ideally situated for future Solar Panel installation on the North facing surface.\n\nWhilst having a rural outlook, a few minutes walk along the picturesque river bank track brings you into the main street of the town. \n\nWynyard is a major historic country town, with good shopping and social facilities and is situated on the estuary of the Inglis River, in the shadow of Table Cape, on the North-West Coast of Tasmania. \nWith retirement, it is time to down-size, so we now, reluctantly, put our beloved family home on the market.\n\nThe enquiry code for this property is 1856. \nYou will be asked for the code when you call about this property.",

"description": "The enquiry code for this property is ( 1188 ) You will be asked for the code when you call about this property.\n\nThis outstanding coastal home is at the exclusive enclave of Dianas basin 10 klms south of St Helens on the Tasman highway. It sits on an elevated ridge that gives stunning 180 degree views of this pristine coast from most rooms and enjoys a private beach over the road with access by path through a 100m of coastal dunes.\n \nThe beach offers truly magnificent walking, fishing and surfing and there is a small boat launch just 300m south opposite Paddy's island. \n\nThe house is 12 yrs old and constructed in timber and colour bond. \nIt is fully insulated and has recently been painted and refurbished throughout with new blinds, light fittings and a new heat pump. Floors are Tasmanian oak.\n\nThe sewage and water storage systems have recently been upgraded and extended to 35K litres with filtration added. \n\nThe garage is 8x6 metres and is also of recent colourbond construction and is lined so would make as excellent workshop or studio. \n\nThe block has been cleared and landscaped for low maintenance and low fire risk. \n\nThe owners are a professional couple retiring to WA and have enjoyed this home for the last 5 yrs. They take away memories of whales, lots of birds and wonderful beach walks.\n\nThe views are so good you just can't ignore them.\nAlso Google street scape photos are 5 yrs out of date \nBlock cleared and landscaped since then.",

You will be asked for the code when you call about this property.\n\nThis is a striking 3 bedroom (plus small office\/nursery) tri level home recently renovated in one of Tannum's sought after streets - walking distance to Coles and the High School, yet backing on to a bush reserve making for a quiet escape from the normal suburban noises. \n\nA recent contract on this property fell through so the owners have reduced the price to meet the market and will accept any offers OVER $480K.\n\nThe home features new granite kitchen, new bathrooms, ceiling fans, light fixtures, oven, hws, window treatments and carpets, has been freshly painted throughout and boasts two private entertaining decks (one upper and one lower) sheltered from the weather with the outlook to the bushlands and sunsets with room for the spa\/bbq\/pool table. Plenty of room for all the toys, with a large driveway, two car garage as well as a two bay shed\/workshop. Please note there is no second lounge\/rumpus room, so suits smaller families. \n\nEasy care gardens with fruit trees supplying limes, lemons, mandarins, oranges, avocados, passionfruit, chillis and bananas year round. Nothing to do but sit and relax while watching the birds and enjoying the kangaroos over your back fence. Quite a unique family home. \n\nOnce again the enquiry code for this property is 1576.

"description": "Ever considered living in one of those luxurious over 50's lifestyle resorts but can't give up the privacy of your own backyard? Well look no further. This home is 5 mins from the beach, close to all amenities and is set on a 450 sqm very private, fenced allotment that backs onto a lake. Put simply, it's irreplaceable as it offers security and companionship, whilst still retaining a residential allotment.\n\nThis architecturally designed home has only been lived in for 2 yrs and is absolutely as brand new. The garage is large enough to fit two large cars easily, has seamless flooring and a r\/c door. The main bedroom with ensuite is extra large and positioned over the lake, catching the beautiful sea breezes. Even the 2nd and 3rd bedrooms have built ins. There is a 4th bedroom or study also looking over the lake. A large family room also is positioned to catch the water views and sea breezes. There is a separate powder room for guests. The kitchen is ultra modern with two PAC cupboards, stone bench tops and stainless steel appliances. \n\nThe large, shady back yard is a beautiful place to hang out, as there is always various forms of wildlife on the lake including ducks, swans, albatross, turtles. A paved deck right on the water is a wonderful place to relax. Or why not go fishing in it? All these benefits make this very private yard a world of its own as soon as you close that front door. However when you do choose to venture out, a totally different lifestyle awaits. \n\nThere are very friendly neighbors and a clubhouse that is so luxurious you wonder how you can afford it! It includes an indoor heated lap pool, an outdoor lagoon pool, a gym, library, arts and craft room, bar, billiard table, stage and cabaret floor, coffee lounge and a bistro offering free weekly meals. The bowls green is carpeted and is fully covered with a state of the art roofing and lighting system. It is arguably the best bowls green in Hervey Bay. The resort also offers daily activities including lawn bowls, zumba, personal gym trainer, yoga, cards, aqua aerobics, line dancing, shopping trips in the resort bus, happy hours, recreational trips. There is also a well equipped workshop for the budding handyman. \n\nThe home is situated on what may be called a perpetual lease that is governed by legislation securing the owner's tenure. Instead of body corporate fees, the owner pays a site fee under the lease. Although similar to body corp fees, it is in reality a site rental and therefore attracts Centrelink rent assistance, making the weekly fee very affordable. This fee includes the rates on the property as well as maintenance of facilities and front yard maintenance. \n\nThe resort is gated with a state of the art intercom system. It is A+ in luxury with too many features to list comprehensively. The owner pays no entry or exit fees and keeps 100% of the capital gain. The temperate climate of the coastal community of Hervey Bay makes this pet-friendly resort very attractive to residents in the southern states seeking an idyllic lifestyle. \n\nNOTE: The enquiry code for this property is 1373.\nYou will need this code when calling about this property.",

Close to all amenities without being hemmed in or overlooked by neighbours. Room to move and create your own peaceful paradise.\n\nKEEP EXISTING HOUSE AND STILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP!\n\n* This property gives you OPTIONS!\n* A renovated 4x1 transportable house offers a rare opportunity to occupy or lease out while developing further dwelling\/s on the site. The house has split system A\/C throughout, with an updated kitchen and bathroom and vacant possession is available RIGHT NOW.\n* Most importantly, this fully transportable house can be EASILY RELOCATED off-site or shifted elsewhere on the block, meaning **NO EXPENSIVE DEMOLITION COSTS** or loss of value associated with demolishing an established, high-spec house.\n* Development will be a very attractive proposition, with MINIMAL SITE COSTS, a wide street frontage, lots of parking and excellent access. Adjoining cul-de-sac at rear provides potential second access to the property allowing a separate driveway to any additional dwelling that is built on the land.\n\nPLUS! * Will consider selling house and land separately. If you are looking for a complete, ready-to-live-in transportable house to relocate to your own block to provide accommodation for additional family members or staff, please contact me to discuss. \n\nThere are plenty of properties on the market but few with such flexibility to suit a range of possibilities. Affordable living and potential plus. There is no better investment than land. Act now or be left wondering what might have been when prices start to rise again as they invariably will.

This bedroom also has a split system A\/C for summer and winter comfort. There are three other bedrooms large enough for queen size beds. All the bedrooms have built in robes.\n\nThe lounge has views and a wood heater which makes it very cosy in winter. The open kitchen has handcrafted sheoak bench tops with gas cooking and electric fan forced oven. The large dining room also has a wood heater and access to an outdoor patio. There is a huge games room with space for a full sized pool table, entertaining and more. It has a built in cupboard and large sliding doors and views.
