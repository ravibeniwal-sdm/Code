       <p class="subtitle">Cut out the middle-man and save thousands</p>
       
       <p>Real estate agent's high advertising and sales commission fees can now be eliminated with the introduction of an innovative online way of buying and selling property. At centralpropertyexchange.com.au (CPx), vendor's can list their property for sale and bypass the traditional real estate agency method by dealing direct with the buyer.</p>
       
       <p>For a nominal $550 listing fee, sellers will potentially save thousands of dollars in unnecessary cost. Sellers and buyers can be confident of a fair and transparent transaction with all properties listed requiring a mandatory independent report. This report compares a property against other similar geographical properties to achieve a current market guide, but the vendor can list at whatever price they want.</p>
       
       <p>This break from traditional practices is the idea of property expert, Anthony Aoun of CPx. "The property market place has changed. Our online service embraces this change by providing a forum where vendors can sell without the influence of a middle-man involved. People stand to save many thousands of dollars as a result.", said Mr Aoun.</p>
       
       <p>With most people only changing properties once or twice in their lifetime, some vendors may choose to involve an independent representative to act on their behalf. Mr Aoun stressed that agents were welcome to participate in the CPx site through application. "This is the future of real estate buying and selling.", said Mr Aoun. The vendor chooses a representative, and the agent and vendor then negotiate their own fee for professional services. There is no set fee.</p>
