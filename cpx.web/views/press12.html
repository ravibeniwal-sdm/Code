         			<p><a href="http://centralpropertyexchange.com.au/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">CentralPropertyExchange.com.au</a> [<a href="http://centralpropertyexchange.com.au/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">CPx</a>] is 'the best alternative' to realestate.com.au and domain.com.au, to <strong>buy / invest</strong> in residential real estate, because…</p>
      				   
                         <p>1. A property is more than four walls and a kitchen. It also includes the financial and ownership structures. These making the 'whole experience’ either, a prudent or, a potentially disastrous purchase. Real estate agents or developers may not be in the best position¹ to answer buyer/ investor enquiries relating to:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Self Managed Super Funds (SMSF)</li>
                                    <li>Fractional ownership via DomaCom</li>
                                    <li>Affordability (best loan scenario)</li>
                                    <li>Ownership structures</li>
                                    <li>Estate planning</li>
                                    <li>Investment</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>2. The traditional real estate sales process fails to accommodate the needs and <strong>interests</strong> of both the buyer and seller: hence the potential for conflict-of-interest exists. For that reason an independent advisor² could be the <strong>best resource</strong> to assist with a property purchase. </p>
                            
                            <p>3. <strong>Loan affordability</strong> is the first and a <strong>key-part</strong> in finding a suitable property. Why then frustrate and waste buyers’/ advisors’ time and money with a restrictive suburb-by-suburb ONLY search whilst trying to find affordable properties? <a href="http://centralpropertyexchange.com.au/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">CPx</a>  offers an <strong>‘affordability search’</strong>, a unique user-experience which makes it instantly possible to find an affordable property, Australia-wide and in any currency. <br /><img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAjkAAAAJDkwY2RkZjZlLWYyZTUtNDg3Ni1iNjQ1LWNhYjIyYTNhZGMyNw.png" style="width: 720px;height: 233px;" /></p>
                            
                            <p>4. Real estate agents no longer hold a monopoly on service delivery. New <strong>cost saving</strong> alternative service-models are being offered. Through <a href="http://centralpropertyexchange.com.au/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">CPx</a> clients may now do it themselves [DIY] or engage independent advisors to help them buy, sell or invest.</p>
                            
                            <p>5. Property buyers <strong>do not trust</strong> real estate agents; hence they may <strong>not</strong> want to engage or enquire³ with the agent/ developer for additional information/ clarity on the listed property.  <a href="http://centralpropertyexchange.com.au/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">CPx</a> offers alternative user-experiences by:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>allowing potential buyers/ advisor's to download or request a <strong>FREE</strong>, six page Independent Property Review and Grade Report [ipr] on any listed property; and</li>
                                    <li>allowing for the submission of a <strong>service-request</strong> to a nominated independent professional(s) to assist with the evaluation and buying process.<br /><img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAk8AAAAJGQzZWIyYTA3LWYyMDctNDU0OC05ZGFkLTE1ZDE5NWFkM2Y5MQ.png" style="width: 720px;height: 288px;" /></li>
                                    
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>6. As property prices increase the opportunity to invest may be limited to a fortunate-few. Also due to the scale of the investment property, investors (or their SMSF) may be exposed to a high level of risk. <a href="http://centralpropertyexchange.com.au/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">CPx</a> via <a href="http://domacom.com.au/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">DomaCom</a> offers <strong>fractional property ownership</strong>. This means an investor using a minimal amount can benefit by being a stake-holder in a property, whilst minimizing overall investment-portfolio risk exposure.</p>
                            
                            <p>7. The property owner, real estate agent/ developer may want to offer a price reduction or saving; <a href="http://centralpropertyexchange.com.au/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">CPx</a> allows for this option.<br /><img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAjgAAAAJGU4NDY1NjBlLTQ1OTAtNGJlOC1hMjU4LTYwOWMzMzM4NjQ0OQ.png" style="width: 374px;height: 79px;" /><br /><br />...so if you are looking for an alternative to realestate.com.au and domain.com.au: a NEW USER-EXPERIENCE, to buy, sell or invest in residential real estate;  <a href="http://centralpropertyexchange.com.au/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">CentralPropertyExchange.com.au</a> [<a href="http://centralpropertyexchange.com.au/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">CPx</a>] is 'the best alternative'.

Yes, there are fees, although these are optional as you can test the water before you spend.  <br /><br /><br /><br /> ¹ There may be several factors preventing a standard real estate agent/ office or developer from assisting buyers. These could include the scope of tools offered by the advertising platform, professional qualifications, independent compliance and many others. <br /><br />² There are over 100,000 financial service professionals (banks, financial planners, mortgage brokers, accountants and solicitors) in Australia, representing <strong>millions</strong> of buyers, whose aim is to assist with <strong>buyers' best interests</strong>. <br /><br />³ Buyers/ advisers may not to refer to an agent/ developer for a number of reasons, one of which may be that they feel that they are being given scripted-answers as opposed to the whole picture. </p>
