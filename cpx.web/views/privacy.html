Landlord Central is firmly committed to protecting your privacy. We recognise the importance of protecting the privacy of information collected about visitors to our website, in particular information that is capable of identifying an individual. This Internet Privacy Policy governs how your personal information, obtained through this web site, will be dealt with.

This privacy policy deals generally with Landlord Central's collection, use and disclosure of information we may have recorded about you. This privacy policy must be read in conjunction with our website terms.

This Privacy Policy should be reviewed periodically so that you are updated on any changes.

For more information about privacy issues in Australia and protecting your privacy, visit the Australian Federal Privacy Commissioner's website (www.privacy.gov.au).
<h2>Your personal information</h2>
Personal information about visitors to our website is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. For example, we may need to collect such information to provide you with further services or to answer or forward any requests or enquiries. It is our intention that this policy will protect your personal information from being dealt with in any way that is inconsistent with applicable privacy laws in Australia.
<h2>How we collect personal information</h2>
In the course of providing our services, we collect personal information in a variety of ways. For example, information is collected when you:
<ul>
 <li>Ask to be placed on one of our mailing lists;</li>
 <li>Ask to be referred to into our network of professionals;</li>
 <li>Apply for a job with us;</li>
 <li>Make an enquiry about our services;</li>
 <li>Visit our web site; or</li>
 <li>Become a client or debtor of the company.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information provided by you</h2>
You provide most of the personal information directly to us and for a specific purpose.
<h2>How we use the information we collect</h2>
Personal information that visitors submit to our website is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted unless we disclose other uses in this Internet Privacy Policy or at the time of collection. Copies of correspondence sent from the website, that may contain personal information, are stored as archives for record-keeping and back-up purposes only. You should be aware that we may use your email address to contact you in the future. We will not sell or pass on your details to third parties.
<h2>Use of the information for a secondary purpose</h2>
We may sometimes use the personal information we collect for a secondary purpose, that is, for use in a way different from the original reason for collection. We will only do this in the following circumstances:
<ul>
 <li>Where you have consented;</li>
 <li>Where the secondary purpose is directly related to the primary purpose, and you would reasonably expect us to use or disclose the information in such a way; or</li>
 <li>Where we are permitted or required by law, or it is in the interests of public safety to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Correcting information</h2>
You can also request that information about you be corrected or deleted. This is part of our commitment to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the information we hold about you is accurate, complete and up-to-date.
<h2>Disclosure</h2>
You should be aware that we may use your email address to contact you in the future. We will not sell or pass on your details to third parties.
<h2>Security</h2>
We strive to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personal information submitted to our website. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure.

However, we will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect the personal information you may transmit to us or from our online products and services. Once we do receive your transmission, we will also make our best efforts to ensure its security on our systems.

In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us. However, we will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to your personal information.
<h2>Links to other websites</h2>
We provide links to websites outside of our web site. These linked sites are not under our control, and we cannot accept responsibility for the conduct of companies linked to our website. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website, we advise you to examine the terms and conditions of using that website and its privacy policy.
