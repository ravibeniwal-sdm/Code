<p>The CPx grade works like a hotel star rating. It provides the disclosure buyers need to find the right property.</p>

<p>Graded is a smart, new concept in the world of real estate. Click here, <a href="#!/blog/FAQs/why-grade-a-property" style="color:#337ab7;" target="_blank" title="FAQ- Why grade a property?">Why grade a property?</a></p>

<p>The objective of this unique approach is to create a level playing field when comparing properties, and to screen out potential biased information and marketing hype that may cloud good decision-making.</p>

<p>The grade is built using proprietary-algorithms and been developed in collaboration with <a href="http://www.jll.com.au/australia/en-au/services/investors-developers/valuations-and-advisory/mortgage-services" target="_blank" class="bluelink" title="JLL">JLL</a> and Landlord Central. This is an individualised service not a system auto-generated product. This means years of real estate knowledge and professional experience form part of the service delivery.  </p>

<p>Being a national-service, by design; each property across Australia is assessed via the same standard and offers buyers several benefits:</p>

<ul>

<li>save time;</li>

<li>save money; and more so</li>

<li>provides unbiased disclosure on a property.</li>

</ul>

<p>Property attributes are assessed and scored to determine a grade, please see below for details. </p>

        </accordion-heading>
         				<p>A score is a number assigned to a property. It&#146s established by assessing a property against pre-determined attributes. The attributes include: historical growth rate; price risk; demographics; internal floor plan flow; street scape and traffic flow; parking; and, outdoor space. </p>
   
                      <p>Each attribute has an associated weighting. Each attribute is scored between Poor (low score) and Excellent (high score). This also determines placement of the tick. Higher scores are more favorable. The sum of the scores for all of the attributes is the total property score. </p>       
   
                        <p>The total points scored are categorised to determine the &#145grade&#146 of the property.</p>

						<p>A grade represents a range of scores. There are five grade categories: AA; A; B; C; and D. The total points scored determines into which grade the property fits. </p>   
                    
                        <p>Since the score of a property is the accumulation of seven attributes; a grade therefore does not indicate a good or bad purchase. It simply shows how the property performs against all seven attributes.</p>
                       
                         <p><b>Which grade is best for me?</b> It all depends on what YOU are looking for! One attribute could be more important to you than the others. It is recommended you look at the individual property attributes to determine which attributes contributed to the overall score. </p>
                       
                           
                       
                         <p>Example 1: an &#145AA&#146 Grade property will have scored highly on all attributes.</p>
                       
                         <p>Example 2: you may be predominately interested in the &#145Price Risk&#146 attribute. In this example, although a property may be assigned with a &#145D&#146 grade, this property may in fact suit your needs, as it has scored well in the &#145Price Risk&#146 attribute. This is shown by a tick under excellent in this attribute.</p>
                       
                         <p><i>Please see image for Example 2, below</i></p>

                       <br>
                       <p>In essence a &#145D&#146 grade property is highly worth considering!</p>
                          
                       <p>The grade assists when conducting a general property search. When you search for a property ALL of the attributes are displayed with a tick. This allows you to review all the attributes against your personal needs.</p>
