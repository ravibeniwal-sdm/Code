       <p class="presspageheader">Self-Sufficiency in the Property Game</p>
       
         			<p>When thinking of buying or selling residential property; what method is best for you?  </p>
      				   
                         <ul>
                            <li>A real estate agent?</li>
                            <li>A buyer's agent?</li>
                            <li>For Sale By Owner website?</li>
                            <li>Investment property specialist?</li>
                            <li>Fractional ownership?</li>
                            <li>Other; i.e. social sites?</li>
                         </ul>
         				
                        <p>In isolation, each method is debated and has its critics and supporters, advantages and disadvantages.</p>
                        
                        <p>What cannot be argued is that none of the above methods offer an independent process. This means as a buyer or seller you are missing-out on the participation of the financial services industry.  The participation of banks, financial planners, mortgage brokers and accountants who collectively serve millions of clients in Australia alone are not a part of the mix.</p>
                        
                        <p>Why limit yourself?</p>
                        
                        <p>Driven by a need for fairness, CentralPropertyExchange.com.au (CPx) created Australia’s first independent buyer focused real estate advertising website.  CPx offers a real estate website with a win/win for buyers and sellers with access to independent financial services professionals. </p>
                        
                        <p>CPx is about providing a viable alternative to be 'self-sufficient' and a way to compliment your existing strategy.  This in-itself is liberating because you can now have it all! After all… it is YOUR property and your future.  You can now have all bases covered to achieve a timely sale.</p>
