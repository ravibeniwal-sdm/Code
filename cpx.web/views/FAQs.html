         				<p>
         					Comparing hits or page views is secondary when the real question is, "what is the buyer's experience?" Please allow us to explain.  
         					A part of the reason why there are so many hits or page views on these sites is because the information is NOT independent or consistent. 
         					Buyers are forced to make numerous enquiries in their efforts to short list suitable properties.  
         					This traditional process can be frustrating for the seller and buyer.  
         					On CPx, the independent listing process mitigates unnecessary enquiries.
         				</p>
         				<p>
         					Another major point to consider, is that buyers come from trusted sources.  For example, when seeking the services of a professional, 
         					a buyer would generally seek guidance from their network.
         				</p>
         				<p>
         					Since the information on CPx is independent, buyer's agents (including the financial services industry) would be the key users of CPx 
         					and are in a better position to offer support in identifying suitable and unbiased information on properties for their clients.
         				</p>
         				<p>
         					The independent process (including the ipr and property grade) allows for finding suitable properties easily and quickly.
         				</p>
         				<p>
         					<b>Advertising revenue at stake:</b> having a large number of hits or page views does not equate to sales or, even, enquiries. For example, 
         					there are many advertising sites in Australia (some offering free listings), but these sites do not offer any advantage over the existing 
         					traditional and 'out-dated' advertising sites. The number of hits and page views are used by these major real estate sites BECAUSE it sounds 
         					impressive and helps to justify advertising fees. 
         				</p>
         				<p>
         					From a practical perspective, it only takes one committed buyer for a sale. There are roughly 500,000 properties sold every year in Australia. 
         					Therefore, one might argue having several millions of hits per month is an inefficient and ineffective process, 
         					ie: a lot of noise when compared to a little result.
         				</p>
         				<p>
         					<b>Bottom line:</b> it isn't the number of hits or page views that ultimately find a buyer, rather the total experience, 
         					which is why CPx's independent process is better for sellers, buyers and industry professionals!

         					nature appeals to the financial services (financial planners, self managed super funds and mortgage brokers). With the knowledge that 
         					CPx properties are graded, with no added real estate agent 'selling-fees' and an independent process, financial service providers can now 
         					confidently add properties to their service offering.

         				<p>
         					CPx is a brand managed by Landlord Central Pty Ltd. Landlord Central has over the years, built a business network of several thousand businesses.
         					This network will be given free access to CPx.  The network data-base consists of financial planners, mortgage brokers, accountants, 
         					buyer's agents and real estate agents.

         				<p>
         					Yes. If your property is listed by an agent with an open-agency agreement then having your property on CPx will be an additional advertising medium.
         				</p>
         				<p>
         					Where you have an exclusive agency agreement CPx recommends you wait until the exclusive period expires before you advertise with CPx.
         				</p>
         				Types of agency and marketing agreements<br>
						The two main types of agreements used to list a property by a real estate agent include:
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
							<li>
								Open agency (non-exclusive); and
							</li>
							<li>
								Exclusive agency.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The commercial terms and obligations within these agreements are imposed on the property seller thus, a thorough understanding is recommended.</p>
						<ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
							<li>
								<b>Non-exclusive also known as open agency agreement:</b> allows the property seller to appoint unlimited agents, marketers, (or others) in their effort to sell their property. 
								The selling-fee is ONLY payable to the agent (or party) that procured the property buyer.
								<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
									<li>
										Terms: are simple and flexible for the property seller (vendor); in essence any party that procures a buyer will be paid the selling-fee.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Exclusive agency agreement:</b> Unless there are special conditions within this agreement; then regardless of who procures the property buyer, 
								the agent with the exclusive agency agreement is also entitled to the selling-fee noted in the agreement.
								<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
									<li>
										Some agents use exclusive agreements as a promise of better results. This may result in a controlled process with limited buyer opportunities. 
										Why? Because it is NOT common practice for real estate agents to share a property listing with other parties claiming to have a buyer.
									</li>
									<li>
										Terms: are rigid for the property seller (vendor). During the agreement period the seller must rely on the one party to procure a buyer.  
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							
						</ul>
						
         				<p>
         					<b>CPx recommends:</b> that a vendor considers using an open agency agreement rather than an exclusive agreement, as open agency agreements pose greater 
         					flexibility. By having your property available via multiple mediums allows all parties to bring forward a potential buyer. A fee is only payable on 
         					results; to the entity that procured the buyer.  
         				</p>
         				
         				<p>
         					<b>Better still:</b> properties listed on CPx do not have a selling-fee and do not need an agency agreement; this is an ideal property medium for 
         					purchasing properties for: the financial services industry; buyer's agents; and international buyers/agents. Unlike the traditional advertising 
         					sites CPx marketplace, allows everybody to trade.
         				</p>
         				
         				<p>
         					<b>CPx governance:</b> please note if the property is already listed with an agent, then the selling-fees MUST be declared prior to listing/ advertising 
         					on CPx. The CPx price is the listed price minus the selling-fees. Buyers are advised that they may purchase the property at the CPx price 
         					(CPx price is the lower price).

         				This style of property advertising is on the increase in Australia for a number of reasons;
         				<ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
         					<li>
         						Vendors want the option to sell their own property without assistance or associated traditional selling-fees payable to an agent. 
         					</li>
         					<li>
         						The advertising rates/ monthly subscriptions for some advertising sites in Australia are unaffordable for small agents. 
         						In their effort to find a new medium for advertising, these agents are collaborating with the vendor's advertising sites, 
         						to list their client's properties.
         					</li>
         					<li>
         						Vendors are recognising that listing a property is a small part of the entire sales process; 
         						hence they can do it themselves, thereby CPx makes their property available to a wider audience.
         					</li>
         				</ul>
         				<p>
         					<b>The CPx advantage</b>

         				CPx offers these fundamental advancements:
         				<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
         					<li>
         						<p><b>National listing standard.</b> In CPx, it is mandatory to have an Independent Property Review (ipr) for every property listed.</p>
         						<p>
         							An ipr involves assigning a grade and independent information to each property. This information is compiled by

         						</p>
         						
         							A free ipr can be downloaded for every property listed. For this reason CPx is able to provide a national listing standard.

         					Unlike other real estate sites, where the information presented with the listed properties is inconsistent. And, even more-concerning relevant 
         					information may be omitted from the listing information. Also, whilst having a large number of properties on a single list is great, with

         					<li>
         						<b>No real estate agent 'selling-fee':</b> In the traditional process, the property for-sale-price includes a real estate agent

         					</li>
         					<li>
         						<p>
         						<b>Independent property review (ipr):</b> In CPx, it is mandatory to have an Independent Property Review (ipr) for every property listed. 
         						The review is valid for three months. In cases where the property remains unsold, a new ipr must be ordered to retain the listing on CPx.

         				</p>
         				<p>
         					A positive aspect of this relatively short list of properties is that viewing these properties on CPx is like viewing a short list of 
         					featured properties. For example, if there was only one property listed, from an entire business network of thousands of property buyer's 
         					visiting CPx, increased consideration would be given to this property for purchase, as opposed to other websites 
         					that require buyers sorting through numerous pages of properties.

         				No. Regardless of the commissions on offer, size or service location of your network, they are presenting their services to procure a buyer.  You only pay the service provider that procured the buyer. Are other service providers within your network being compromised when one of them does procure a buyer?  Of course they are not, as only one party can secure the sale.
         				</p>
         				<p>
         				CPx is an advertising platform and may be viewed as another channel within your network to sell your properties. Some service providers use a percentage of their sales commission as a rebate or referral fee to entice a buyer. CPx, as a business model, transforms these commissions into &#145savings&#146 to the buyer. This selling strategy also makes your property sale price better value for money.

         				<p>
         				Yes, of course. A Grade is determined by a range of scores that places a property in one of five categories: AA, A, B, C and D. The total points scored determine which of these Grades a property fits into and can assist the vendor with their property pricing.
         				</p>
         				<p>
						The score of a property is comprised of seven comparative attributes, and the resulting Grade does not indicate a good or bad purchase. It simply shows how the property performs related to these seven attributes.
         				</p>
   
         				
         				<p>Which Grade is best for a buyer? No Grade in particular as one attribute could be more important to a buyer than others. CPx recommends buyers compare individual property attributes to determine which contribute more strongly to the overall score.</p>
         				
         				<p>The fact is any Grade of property is worth considering.  It all depends upon what the buyer is looking for.  <a ng-click="gotorate()" href="#!/about/what-is-graded" title="what is graded-Grade">more...</a></p>

         				<p><b><i>1. Who are DomaCom and what do they do?</i></b></p> 
         				<p>DomaCom is a fractional (meaning: share or unit) property investing fund that allows investors to buy units in a property instead of buying the whole property.  This is similar to buying shares but these shares are in property, and are acquired through a regulated Managed Investment Scheme (MIS). DomaCom and its related services manage the properties on behalf of unit holders. DomaCom provides a secure ASIC regulated structure for investors to diversify their unit holdings across a range of properties, without owning the whole property, and therefore, broadening their potential profit and risk. </p>
         				
         				<p><b><i>2. How does buying investment property through DomaCom work?</i></b></p>
         				<p>Through a DomaCom accredited Financial Advisor, investors buy units in properties through a DomaCom public or private &#145book build&#146 (joint property investment).  There is a minimum investment of $20,000, however, this sum can then be spread across a number of properties or fully invested into one property.  How much you invest is up to you.  When over 30%-50% of units in a property are sold, DomaCom organises due diligence on the property.  When units sold reach the property sale price, DomaCom purchases the property and places this investment into a sub-fund, with each investor allocated units in the property relevant to their investment.</p>
         				
         				<p><b><i>3. Can I choose my own property to invest in?</i></b></p>
         				<p>Investors can select which property they would like to buy units in through an established public <b>book build</b>,or their advisor can create a new public or private book build.   If the property has a registered Title, you can buy it through DomaCom.  Properties may include farms, land, off the plan, student accommodation, warehouse units, commercial to aircraft hangers.  Current exclusions are overseas properties, however, will be included in DomaCom&#146s future expansion.</p>
         				<p>You can diversify your property investment across a range of properties or choose just one.  Your choices may be based upon location, style of property or price, or may be recommended by your advisor.  Book builds are created by fund advisors, however, will need the client base to ensure the property&#146s book build units all sell to enable purchase of the property.  You can also opt to join one of the public book builds if your advisor is unable to create a suitable book build that meets your needs.</p>	
   
						<p><b><i>4. How do I earn money from my investment?</i></b></p>
						<p>Once a property is purchased, a sub-fund is created for the property and investors are allocated units in the sub-fund based upon the value of their investment.  DomaCom proceeds to manage the property, with investors paying a share of ongoing expenses related to usual property ownership and management costs.  Investors receive a share of the property rent and the future capital value of the property with the security of the property title being held by the Custodian of the Fund on behalf of the unit holders.</p>
						
						
						<p><b><i>5. What if I want to sell some or all of my property units?</i></b></p>
						<p>Basically, you can sell your share in a property at any time through the DomaCom site.  DomaCom has three ways for you to do this.  </p>
						<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
						<li>a) At any time a unit holder can sell their share on DomaCom&#146s secondary market to other investors, with first option to purchase being given to other unit holders;</li><br>
						<li>b) At any time unit holders with a minimum 5% share in a property may choose, by deciding vote, to sell the property, with first option to purchase being given to other unit holders;</li><br>
						<li>c) After Five years the property reaches an expiry date where unit holders are given the option to vote to hold or sell the property.  It is at this point you can choose to exit your interest in the property with first option to purchase being given to other unit holders.</li><br>
						
						</ul>
						
						<p><b><i>6. Is fractional investing with DomaCom a safe investment?</i></b></p>
						<p>Investing is never 100% safe, however, buying units in a range of property/ies is a tangible asset that provides rental income and equity growth.  The benefit of buying units in DomaCom book build properties is the ability to develop a diversified property portfolio instead of investing all your money in one property.  DomaCom also provides a secondary market enabling the sale of units should an investor choose to sell some or all of their interest in a property.</p>

         				<p><b><i>1. What is a Self Managed Super Fund (SMSF)?</i></b></p> 
						<p>A SMSF is a trust fund set up by its members to gain greater control and choice over the investment options of their superannuation monies than is available through traditional superannuation funds. A SMSF operates as a government regulated trust that must have four or less beneficiary members who are also trustees of the fund.  The SMSF has to exist solely for the purpose of growing wealth to provide retirement income for the fund members.  For more information on SMSF go to <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/" target="_blank" title="SMSF">https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/</a> </p>
						
						         				
         				<p><b><i>2. What are the rules when buying property through a SMSF? </i></b></p>
						<p>When you set up a SMSF, you and the other fund members are in charge of what you invest in.  When investing in property through your SMSF, the property of choice must be acquired for the sole purpose of growing investment wealth for fund members.  The property must not have any connection to any fund member or their family and it cannot be lived in or rented by a fund member or their family.  It is, however, permitted to purchase a commercial property that is then rented at the market rate by a fund member, with this rent being paid directly to the SMSF.  The purchase of any property through a SMSF must be done in accordance with the super and tax laws and is regulated by the Australian Taxation Office.</p>
						
						         				
         				<p><b><i>3. How do I fund a property purchase through my SMSF?</i></b></p>
         				<p>Your SMSF may have enough funds for an outright purchase of an investment property, but if not, or you choose to borrow and diversify your investments, then Limited Recourse Borrowing Arrangements (LRBA) can be used to secure the balance of purchase price on a single asset or group of equal value assets.  The property/ies purchased with a LRBA are held in a regulated holding trust with any investment earnings being paid to the SMSF trustees.  In the event the LRBA loan is fully repaid, the SMSF trustees gain ownership of the property and it is then transferred out of the holding trust and into the trust.  LRBA ensures the protection of other unrelated SMSF assets should a loan be defaulted upon.</p>
								   
						<p><b><i>4. What kind of properties can be bought through a managed SMSF?</i></b></p>
						<p>The main rule for buying an investment property through your SMSF is that it is purchased with the sole purpose of building your fund&#146s wealth.  The type of property purchased can be residential, business commercial or rural commercial.  Funds can be used to maintain a property but there are restrictions around renovating a property owned by the fund that must be adhered to.  Examples of property you cannot buy using your SMSF are; contract of sale and a contract for build, holiday homes and your family home.  To abide by the SMSF rules, the fund trustees must always ensure there is no conflict of interest and that any property purchased observes the &#147sole purpose test&#148, <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/investing/sole-purpose-test/" target="_blank" title="SMSF">https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/investing/sole-purpose-test/</a> </p>

Customers are assured of regulatory compliance and transparency for all parties involved through an annual account audit.  Customers have the ability to log on to their online account to view transaction status at any time. A statement is provided to account holders to track account activity and also a <a href="https://beta.confidis.com.au/addfunds/admin/transactions/funds_certificate_sample" target="_blank" title="Certificate of Funds">Certificate of Funds</a> which underwrites the amounts held in trust.</p>						
						         				
         				<p><b><i>2. Why is using Confidis Pty Ltd a good idea?</i></b></p>
						<p>Errors in the management of trust account funds may lead to unintentional issues with staff, family or customers, or a worst case scenario of investigation by the Department of Fair Trading.   Professionals can risk disqualification from their livelihood through loss of their practicing license due to trust fund breach.  There is an annual independent audit of trust funds where the compliance and efficient disbursement of monies is scrutinised.

						<p><b><i>4. What is a Certificate of Funds?</i></b></p>
						<p>A Certificate of Funds allows the holder of the account to disburse trust funds to other parties in accordance to transaction amounts detailed in the certificate.  It provides an official detailed record of transactions for transparency in the management of the trust fund, and sets out the terms and conditions related to the holding and disbursing of monies held.  The funds held in trust and noted within the Certificate of Funds are underwritten by AIG Australia. Example: <a href="https://beta.confidis.com.au/addfunds/admin/transactions/funds_certificate_sample" target="_blank" title="Certificate of Funds">Certificate of Funds</a>.</p>						
						   
   						
   						<p><b><i>5. What kind of transactions can a Confidis Pty Ltd account be used for?</i></b></p>

						<p>Because property buyers want independent information. </p> 
						
						<p>There was once a time when you had to select a hotel without the assistance of a star rating, 
						buy a car without an ANCAP safety rating, and purchase an appliance without an energy efficiency rating.
						 You were forced to decide based on marketing hype and emotion. Talk about unreliable! </p>
						 
						 <p>Thankfully these industries have since changed. Your rights as a consumer were recognised and 
						 your protection was prioritised. You now have the ability to make an informed decision and 
						 appropriately compare before buying.</p>
						 
						 <p>But, the truth is you don't have this same level of protection across all services - and buying
						  a home or investment property is one of them.</p>
						  
						 <p>Recognising the long and overdue need for the real estate industry to serve property buyers, 
						 CPx has created a new industry standard by grading properties and giving buyers access to 
						 fair and independent information.</p>
						 
						 <h4><i>The CPx grade works like a hotel star rating. It provides the disclosure buyers need to
						  find the right property. </i></h4>

						 <p>Acting as an independent property rating system, the CPx property grade allows you to evaluate
						  individual properties based on historical growth rate, price risk, demographics, internal floor 
						  plan flow, street scape/traffic flow, parking and outdoor space; so you can evaluate and compare 
						  properties most suited to you quickly and easily.</p>
						 
						
						
						<p>Properties are graded by leading property experts at JLL
						 Pty Ltd, giving you the peace of mind knowing that you are basing your financial 
						 decisions on independent, accurate information - not just emotion or marketing hype.</p>
						
						
						
						<p>You have to live with the consequences of your property decision a lot longer than an appliance,
						 vacation or car, so before you buy your next property, ensure it&#8217;s graded.</p>
